# When I run things

I'm planning a blog post on this (eventually), but wanted to start collecting / recording thoughts here. Basically, I've seen a lot of different ways to run a company over the course of my career -- both directly (by working in many different environments) and indirectly (through friends and companies publicly releasing their practices). As a result, it's been almost impossible to avoid creating a list of things that I'd do were I in charge of my own company.

I'm dividing this up into rough categories, but expect the format to change dramatically over time.
