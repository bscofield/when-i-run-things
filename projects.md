# Projects

* Anyone can propose a project, but you can only work on it if you can convince at least one other person to devote a significant amount of their time to it.
* Projects are led (at first) by the proposer; later, the project team may agree to transfer the project to a new owner.
* Project updates are frequent -- at least weekly, and ideally much more often.
* A project proposal includes at least the following:
  * how it contributes to the company's goals.
  * how success will be measured.
  * what will be built (the MVP, most likely)
  * what the next steps would be beyond the first iteration
  * the risks that may prevent success
* [Someone / some group of people] can veto project proposals, but the reason for the veto has to be made public.
