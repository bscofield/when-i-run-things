# Projects

## Kickoff
* Anyone can propose a project, but it'll only go forward (beyond the proposal) if you can convince at least one other person to devote a significant amount of their time to it.
* A project proposal includes at least the following:
  * how it contributes to the company's goals; short-term and long-term gains should both be addressed.
  * how success will be measured.
  * what will be built (the MVP, most likely)
  * what the next steps would be beyond the first iteration
  * the risks that may prevent success
* New and in-progress proposals are visible to everyone, and are discussed at a regular company meeting.
* The larger team can veto project proposals, but the reason for the veto has to be made public -- and a significant number of the full team must agree to the veto.

## In-progress
* Projects are led (at first) by the proposer; later, the project team may agree to transfer the project to a new owner.
* Project updates are frequent -- at least weekly, and ideally much more often.

## Maintenance
* Project teams are responsible for the ongoing maintenance of what they deliver if any is required.

## Post-mortems
* Every project should generate a post-mortem, informed by the project's success or failure (as defined in the proposal) and the updates during the process. Ideally, we'll be generating content for the post-mortem as we go along (both to reduce the work required at the end and to increase its accuracy).
